## 💡 **Best Practices and Pro Tips**

### **Starting a New Project**
1. **Always begin with scope analysis**: `@task-scope-analyzer [project description]`
2. **Use meta-coordinator for complex projects**: `@genesis-meta-coordinator [comprehensive project brief]`
3. **Be specific about constraints**: Include timeline, budget, team size, compliance requirements
4. **Request evolution strategies**: Use `@evolution-strategy-planner` for continuous improvement

### **Optimizing Existing Projects**
1. **Regular performance monitoring**: `@agent-performance-monitor [current metrics and issues]`
2. **Technology stack reviews**: `@technology-stack-specialist [current stack and pain points]`
3. **Team restructuring**: `@agent-ecosystem-designer [current team structure and challenges]`
4. **Genetic trait evolution**: `@evolution-strategy-planner [performance gaps and goals]`

### **Multi-Agent Coordination**
1. **Start with 2-3 agents maximum**: Too many agents can create conflicting advice
2. **Use sequential consultation**: Get scope analysis before ecosystem design
3. **Combine complementary agents**: `@technology-stack-specialist` + `@agent-ecosystem-designer`
4. **Save complex coordination for meta-coordinator**: Let `@genesis-meta-coordinator` orchestrate complex multi-agent workflows

### **Genetic Trait Management**
1. **Monitor trait effectiveness**: Track which genetic combinations work best for your domain
2. **Evolve gradually**: Don't make dramatic genetic changes all at once
3. **Balance traits**: Avoid extreme values unless specifically needed
4. **Context-specific genetics**: Different projects need different genetic profiles
